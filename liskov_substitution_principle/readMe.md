Exercise: The Audio Player

Scenario:

You're building a simple audio player application. You have a base class AudioPlayer that can play audio files. You also have a subclass PremiumAudioPlayer that, in addition to playing audio, allows users to adjust the playback speed. However, there's a problem in the design that violates the LSP.
